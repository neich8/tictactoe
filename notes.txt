##NOTES###

#player can make a turn
	#first person to go is random

#Board is an array with 9 spots
	#can be sorted differently to easily check for matches in rows and columns and diagonal

#Rotate players turns





# Need Table with 9 spaces
## needs to have 3 rows or 
# Need to have X's and O's
# spaces can only have an X or O


###ALGORITHM####

1. First move should be middle spot
	If not go for random corner either 1, 3, 7, or 9
2. Second move match player 2's row column or diagonal then follow rule 1 if possible

#starting on move three
3. See if 3 in a row can be completed if so then do it

4. If other player has two in a row block it!



##ORDER OF STUFF####

# To start game 

Board needs to exist -- DONE

Choose first player 


###ALGO PT 2

Find Possible blocks
If each have same space that blocks multiples take it
	if more than one has that and can get 2 in one row
		if corner spot available
			TAKE IT!!!
		end
	end
end

## TO DOS

Instantiate ALgorithim Module
	1 check to make three in a row -> DONE
	2 check for enemy two in a row. -> DONE

		3 if Comp has two in a row do it -> DONE
			6 check to create two in a row -> DONE
				5 Check to see if any blocks -> DONE
					6 check corners -> DONE
						7 if both put in that spot -> DONE
				8 if no blocks put in middle  -> DONE


				If more than one two way win 
				then create 2 in a row while avoiding two way wins

				needs to go up 3 moves
