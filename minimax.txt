Mini max strategy

needs to create every possible outcome

first move should come up with nine possible outcomes
second eight possible outcomes.
def minimax
board.each do |spot|
		spot = "X"
	if spot.lose? 
		return -1
	elsif spot.win?
		return +1
	elsif spot.tie?
		return 0
	else 
		minimax
	end
	return


each possible outcome of a win is +1 and a loss is -1 
tie is 0

points tally up and best possible move ie one with most points is selected
